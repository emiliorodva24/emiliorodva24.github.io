### CPSC 120

* Lab 1, Part 1 

    I liked this lab because it was fun and simple. Since it was my first lab, it introduced me to how C++ programs take input from the user and create outputs based on what is typed. I also learned how to use std::string, how to format prompts correctly, and why compiling often helps avoid big mistakes later. It was satisfying to see the program come together and print a full paragraph using the words I entered. Overall, this lab made me feel more confident about writing basic C++ programs and following proper formatting rules.

* Lab 2, Part 1

    I enjoyed this lab because it introduced me to how programs can output calculations based on the user’s input. It also gave me an understanding of how parameters and return values work, since we had to write functions that calculated BMR for men and women using the given formulas. I learned how important it is to compile and test often, especially when working with math in a program. Overall, this lab helped me better understand how different parts of a program connect to produce an output.

* Lab 5, Part 1

    This lab was interesting because it showed me how command-line arguments can be used to take input before the program even runs. I liked seeing how the program could build a full sentence based on what the user typed after the command. I also learned the importance of validating input and making sure the user enters the correct number of arguments so the program doesn’t crash. Using the test cases helped me understand how to check for errors and make sure the output formatting matches. Overall, this lab helped me feel more comfortable working with vectors in C++, and it was fun to see the final program create a sandwich order.
